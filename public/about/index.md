I am a budding game-developer looking for opportunities in graphics, engine & tools programming; a pragmatic Software Engineer with extensive knowledge indeveloping applications with open-source technologies. I enjoy the journey fromvague ideas to a fully realized products. Achieving common goals and the teamâ€™spriorities are my guiding principles.


I am currently pursuing Masters of Science in Computer Science at DigiPen Institute of Technology, honing my skills in the field of Computer Graphics and game development (expecting graduation in April 2021). My main interests lie in real-time rendering techniques, game engine and tools development. Apart from work, I am a die-hard Manchester City FC fan, and in my liesure time, I like to catch-up on football (soccer). Unsurprisingly FIFA, and Football Manager are my favourite video games. I also delve into portrait sketching from time to time.


While you are here, do have a look at my work. I would love the opportunity to discuss the projects I have worked on, the technologies, and the projects that interest me. Otherwise, hit me at Dushyant#7596 on Discord, and we can chat about all things space, football, Harry Potter, and Batman.
